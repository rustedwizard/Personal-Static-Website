# Personal-Static-Website (Under development)

Rusted Wizard Personal Website (Azure Static Web version).

This under-developing website is a replacement of previous website (gone offline on 2020/08/18), which is based on ASP.Net core and hosted on Azure app service. This newly developed website will be hosted on Azure Static Web App. It is expected that this newly developed website will present similar(if not same) functions and running at lower cost.
